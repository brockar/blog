Hey! I’m **Martin**. This blog is where I share my adventures with Linux, code, and 3D printing—stuff I find fun and worth documenting.

### **What You’ll Find Here**  
- 🐧 **Linux**: Configs, distro hops, and terminal tricks.  
- 💻 **Code Snippets**: Mostly Rust, Python, and Bash—things I use daily.  
- 🖨️ **3D Printing**: CAD designs, troubleshooting, and mods.  
- 🔧 **Random Projects**: Whatever else I’m hacking on.  

### **Who Am I?**  
I'm a Computer Engineering student who believes the best way to understand systems is to take them apart. While I don't yet have formal IT experience,
